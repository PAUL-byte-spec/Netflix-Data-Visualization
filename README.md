# Netflix Shows and Movies Data Analysis
# Overview
This repository contains code for performing data preparation, cleaning, exploration, and visualization on a dataset containing information about Netflix shows and movies. The dataset was for an assignment and includes tasks such as unzipping the dataset, addressing missing values, exploring data, and creating visualizations both in Python and R.

# Getting Started
 To run the Policy Management System:
 * Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from here.
 * Clone the repository to your local machine: https://github.com/PAUL-byte-spec/Netflix-Data-Visualization.git
 * Navigate to the project directory: cd Netflix Movies1
 * Run the main script: python main.py


# Files Included
  * Netflix_shows_movies.zip: The original dataset in a compressed format.
  * Netflix_ cleaned_dataset.csv: The cleaned dataset after addressing missing values.
  * Nexford Movies1.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for unzipping the dataset and 
    renaming it.
  * Nexford Movies1.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for addressing missing values in the 
    dataset.
  * Nexford Movies1.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for exploring the dataset and 
    performing statistical analysis.
  * Nexford Movies1.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for creating visualizations of 
    most 
    watched genres and ratings distribution.
  * Visualization in R most watched Genres: R script for creating a ratings distribution histogram.
  * README.md: This README file.

# Requirements
  To run the code in the provided notebooks, you need the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

  * pandas
  * numpy
  * seaborn
  * matplotlib
    
For running the R script, you need the following R packages:

  * ggplot2

# Usage
 * Data Preparation: Run Nexford Movies1.ipynb to unzip the dataset and rename it to 
  "Netflix_shows_movies".
 * Data Cleaning: Nexford Movies1.ipynb to address missing values in the dataset.
 * Data Exploration: Open Nexford Movies1.ipynb to explore the dataset, generate summary 
   statistics, and perform statistical analysis.
 * Data Visualization: Run Nexford Movies1.ipynb to create visualizations representing the most 
   watched genres and ratings distribution using Python libraries.
   Execute ratings_distribution.R to create the ratings distribution histogram in R.

# Notes
  * Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access and modify files in the directory.
  * Replace file paths in the code with your actual file paths before running the notebooks or 
    scripts.
  * You can modify the code and visualizations according to your specific requirements or 
    preferences.
